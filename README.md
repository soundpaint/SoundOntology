Ontological Processing of Sound Resources
==

While this project has been discontinued as of 2006, I put it here for
documentation purposes.  I also explicitly invite others to build upon
this work.

Abstract
--
Modern music production systems provide a plethora of sound resources,
e.g. hundreds or thousands of sound patches on a synthesizer.  The
more the number of available sounds grows, the more difficult it
becomes for a user to find the desired sound resource for a particular
purpose, thus demanding for advanced retrieval techniques based on
sound classification.

This project introduces an ontology written in the <code>OWL</code>
Ontology Web Language for managing sound resources.  The ontology
resides in the <code>src/owl</code> subdirectory.

For project documentation, see the LAC2006 conference paper and
associated slides in the <code>doc</code> directory.  The paper gives
a short survey of existing approaches on classification and retrieval
of sound resources.  Then, it discusses management of such resources
and presents an advanced approach based on ontological knowledge
processing.
